What if you could harness the power of standards-compliant ECMAScript
(JavaScript), HTML Canvas 2D Context, and WebSocket connections to create and
share 2D games entirely in your browser?

Learn2D is an educational programming platform to teach students how to program
and play 2D multiplayer games.

> "The read–eval–print loop (REPL) is one of the most powerful ways to learn a
> programming language. Learn2D's HTML Canvas 2D support takes it a step
> further. Learn2D's
> cloud development IDE is the fastest way to learn to program." - Chris M. Welsh

We are still in alpha but here is a screenshot of the client running on Safari
on iPhone 4S with multiple players connected:
