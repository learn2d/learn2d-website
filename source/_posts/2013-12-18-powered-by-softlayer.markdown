I'm excited to announce that Learn2D is now powered by SoftLayer.

Dallas-based cloud platform provider SoftLayer Technologies hosts and mentors
hundreds of tech startups from around the world under the company's incubation
program, known as the SoftLayer Catalyst Program. It's great to be a part of
this program, and I'm absolutely positive that there is no better hosting
provider for the unique matchup of online programming education with real-time
interactive data streaming through the WebSocket protocol.

Many regards to SoftLayer for providing us this opportunity to expand our
hosting capabilities during this high-growth period as we prepare for a public
beta release.
